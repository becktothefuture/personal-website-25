/**
 * Smooth Scroll Placeholder
 * ------------------------
 * This module has been removed as Lenis smooth scrolling is now implemented directly in Webflow.
 * 
 * The previous functionality:
 * - Created a smooth scrolling experience using the Lenis.js library
 * - Implemented vertical inverted scrolling
 * - Provided scroll events that could be consumed by other modules
 * - Optimized performance by replacing native scroll
 * - Integrated with scrollTracker for consistent scroll metrics

};
